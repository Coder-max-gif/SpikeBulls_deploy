    q: "What markets and timeframes are supported?",

  {
    q: "Do I need a VPS to run the Algo Strategy?",
    a: "Strongly recommended. A VPS keeps your MT5 terminal online 24/5 with stable latency. We provide step-by-step setup for popular VPS providers in the bundle."
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a free trial?",
    a: "We offer a 14-day demo license on request so you can run both products on a demo MT5 account before purchasing. Contact support to enable it."
  },
  {
    q: "How do updates work?",
    a: "All purchases include lifetime updates. New versions are pushed automatically through our license portal — no reinstall, no extra fees."
  },
  {
    q: "What broker do I need?",
    a: "Any MT5 broker works. For best execution we recommend ECN brokers with sub-100ms latency to a major liquidity hub (London, NY, Frankfurt)."
  },
  {
    q: "Is this financial advice?",
    a: "No. Our products are technology tools. All trading carries risk, past performance does not guarantee future results, and you are responsible for your own decisions."
